Don't forget check netcat as that is an option from a server without printing services
Cups- Common unix printing system
lp file1 # should print file1 with default printer
Next, the CUPS daemon (cupsd) assigns the print job a unique print job ID and places a copy of the print job into a temporary directory
on the filesystem called the print queue
lp file1 ----> /var/spool/cups ------->printer1         cups and printer both need to be configured
       spooling		       printing
LPSTAT-
-a Displays a list of printers that are accepting print jobs
-d Displays the default destination printer
-o printername Displays the print jobs in the print queue for printername only
-p Displays a list of printers that are enabled
-r Shows whether the CUPS daemon (scheduler) is running
-t Shows all information about printers and their print jobs

You can manipulate the status of a printer using either the cupsaccept, cupsreject, cupsenable, or cupsdisable command followed by the
printer name
cupsdisable -r "Changing toner cartridge" printer1  # to give a reasoning for future reference 
 lp -d printer1 /etc/inittab   # -d lets you choose destination printer
 lp -d printer1 /etc/hosts /etc/issue # multiple files if you choose
cancel printer1-1 printer1-2 # would cancel both of these print jobs
switches /options  to use with lp
-d 	printername Specifies the name of printer to send the print job.
-i 	print job ID Specifies a certain print job ID to modify.
-n 	number Prints a certain number of copies.
-m 	Mails you confirmation of print job completion.
-o 	option Specifies certain printing options. Common printing options include the following: cpi=number—Sets the characters per inch 
to number. landscape—Prints in landscape orientation. number-up=number—Prints number pages on a single page, where number is 1, 2, or 4.
sides=string—Sets double-sided printing, where string is either ‘two-sided-short-edge’ or ‘two-sided-long-edge’.
-q 	priority Specifies a print job priority from 1 (low priority) to 100 (high priority). By default, all print jobs have a priority of
50.

switches /options to use with lpstat
-a 	Displays a list of printers that are accepting print jobs
-d 	Displays the default destination printer
-o	 printername Displays the print jobs in the print queue for printername only
-p 	Displays a list of printers that are enabled

configuration file for cups
/etc/cups/cupsd.conf #configuration file for cups daemon
/etc/cups/printers.conf #configuration for each individual printer
# cups will automatically detect and create individual printer name based on manufacturing information for each printer that is not
automatically detected. You must create the data.
The most comprehensive way to create and manage CUPS printers is by using the CUPS Web administration tool, which gives Linux 
administrators the ability to create and manage all printers settings
You can access the CUPS Web administration tool using a Web browser on TCP port 631 by navigating to http://servername:631,

Although CUPS is the preferred printing system for Linux computers today, many older Linux computers use the traditional Line Printer
Daemon (LPD) printing system
 lpr command is used to print documents to the print queue much like the lp command
 lpc command can be used to view the status of printers
lpq command can be used to view print jobs in the print queue
lprm command can be used to remove print jobs, much like the cancel command

Networked printers
 By default, the CUPS daemon detects locally connected and network-shared printers and automatically adds an entry for them in the 
 /etc/cups/printers.conf file using a name based on the printer model number (e.g., HP Laserjet 6M)
You can provide a series of options to the lpadmin command discussed earlier to configure a printer on the system
^^^ using the config files manually may cause problems

manipulate the status of a printer using either the cupsaccept, cupsreject, cupsenable, orcupsdisable command followed by the printer
name
accept or rejects refers to spool weather it can accept spool or not enable and disable refers to printing spool weather daemon will
automatically print or not
[root@server1 ~]# cupsaccept printer1 
[root@server1 ~]# cupsdisable printer1 


You can restrict access to certain printers by using the lpadmin command. For example, to deny all users other than root and
user1 from printing to the printer1 printer created earlier, you can use the following command:
lpadmin –u allow:root,user1 –u deny:all –d printer1
