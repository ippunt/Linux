   The first file, /etc/login.defs, contains parameters that set the default location for e-mail, password expiration information
, minimum password length, and the range of UIDs and GIDs available for use
In addition, it determines whether home directories will be automatically made during user creation,
 as well as the password hash algorithm used to store passwords within /etc/shadow. 

The second file, /etc/default/useradd, contains information regarding the default primary group,
 the location of home directorie the default number of days to disable accounts with expired passwords,
 the date to disable user accounts, the shell used, and the skeleton directory used
 
The skeleton directory, which is /etc/skel on most Linux systems, contains files that are copied to all new users’ home directories

options or switches for useradd
-c 	 “description” Adds a description for the user to the GECOS field of /etc/passwd.
-d	 homedirectory Specifies the absolute pathname to the user’s home directory.
-e 	expirydate Specifies a date to disable the account from logging in.
-f 	days Specifies the number of days until a user account with an expired password is disabled.

user and made the primary group for that user.
-G 	group1, group2,etc. Specifies all other group memberships for the user account.
-m 	Specifies that a home directory should be created for the user account. By default in Fedora Linux, home directories are created
for all users via an entry in the /etc/login.defs file. However, in many other Linux distributions, a home directory is not created
unless this option is specified.
-k 	directory Specifies the skeleton directory used when copying files to a new home directory.
-s 	shell Specifies the absolute pathname to the shell used for the user account.
-u 	UID Specifies the UID of the user account.
