command 0<file command <file
The Standard Input of a command is taken from a file.
ie:sort 0<MixedUpFile # Prints your mixed up file by alphabetical order to screen
sort 0<MixedUpFile > FileByAlphabeticalOrder  # now your sorted file will be outputted to the FileByAlphabeticalOrder
Initial file is never changed due to using standard input and never putting output into it
