Test box:
ufw enable
ufw deny out to 192.168.0.0/16
ufw deny out to 172.16.0.0/12
ufw deny out to 10.0.0.0/8
ufw allow out to IP_OF_DNS_Server
 
0.1 
ufw status; the action will tell you if its out if its just deny its in.
ufw status numbered; will tell you out or in additionally
iptables -nvL; will let you see exactly what is happening and may be necessary. 
ufw deny to 192.168.0.0/16 by default is an input chain whether you state to or from
ufw deny out to 192.168.0.0/16  will block all connections initiated from the machine to this address. 

 

1. UFW Basics 

Ufw status; Tells you the status of the firewall.  
Ufw status verbose; 
Ufw enable; turns it on 
Ufw disable; turns it off 
 
2. Default file locations and altering them 

Cat /etc/default/ufw 

Sudo ufw default deny incoming 

Sudo ufw default allow outgoing 

 

When installing software with app it will add a profile. 

Cat /etc/ufw/applications.d 

Sudo ufw app list 

Sudo ufw app info 'Apache'; gives you more information about the apps 

 

IPv6 

Echo "IPV6=yes" >> /etc/default/ufw; just example may have to change boolean I haven't looked to see if default is non-commented.  

Configure 
Ufw allow ssh; 
Ufw allow 2222/tcp; 
Ufw deny ssh/tcp 
Ufw deny 2222/tcp; 

Many different ways to allow access to Apache: 
Ufw allow http; By service name 
Ufw allow 80/tcp; by port and protocol 
Ufw allow 'Apache'; by application profile 
Many different ways for Apache Secure: 
Ufw allow https; 
Ufw alow 443/tcp; 
Ufw allow 'Apache Secure'; 
 

Port ranges 
Ufw allow 4200:4300/tcp 
Ufw allow 5200:5300/udp 

Specific IP 
Ufw allow from 1.1.1.1; 
Ufw allow from 1.1.1.1 to any port 22;  
Ufw allow from 1.1.1.1/24 to any port 22; 
Ufw allow from 1.1.1.1 to 2.2.2.2 port 80; 
 

Deletes 
Ufw status numbered; 

Ufw delete 3;  
Delete all: 
Ufw reset; 
Ufw status; 

10. Files and behavior 

The UFW firewall can manage to do anything that iptables does. This can be done with different sets of rules files, which are nothing, but simple iptables-restore text files. 

Tuning of UFW firewall or adding additional iptables commands are not permitted via ufw command, is a just matter of altering following text files 

/etc/default/ufw: The main configuration file with pre-defined rules. 

/etc/ufw/before[6].rules: In this file rules are calculated before adding via ufw command. 

/etc/ufw/after[6].rules: In this file rules are calculated after adding via ufw command. 

/etc/ufw/sysctl.conf: This file is used to tune kernel network. 

/etc/ufw/ufw.conf: This file enable the ufw on boot.
