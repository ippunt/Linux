T-Shoot: iptables -L -n -v
1. Nating all open servies on one host to a single service same IP
2. Changing IP of destination
3. Notes on MASQUERADE PAT
4. ICMP
5. Subnet and Multihost
6. Persistance

Per iptables manual, there are currently 3 types of tables:

FILTER – this is the default table, which contains the built in chains for:
	INPUT  – packages destined for local sockets
	FORWARD – packets routed through the system
	OUTPUT – packets generated locally
NAT – a table that is consulted when a packet tries to create a new connection. It has the following built-in:
	PREROUTING – used for altering a packet as soon as it’s received
	OUTPUT – used for altering locally generated packets
	POSTROUTING – used for altering packets as they are about to go out
MANGLE – this table is used for packet altering. Until kernel version 2.4 this table had only two chains, but they are now 5:
	PREROUTING – for altering incoming connections
	OUTPUT – for altering locally generated  packets
	INPUT – for incoming packets
	POSTROUTING – for altering packets as they are about to go out
	FORWARD – for packets routed through the box

start and stop with systemd
 systemctl start iptables
# systemctl stop iptables
# systemctl restart iptables

start and stop older versions sysV

/etc/init.d/iptables start 
/etc/init.d/iptables stop
/etc/init.d/iptables restart

Check all IPtables Firewall Rules
iptables -L -n -v

Block Specific IP Address in IPtables Firewall
iptables -A INPUT -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j DROP	#note -A is to append the rule
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j DROP 	#-p to choose prtotocol tcp/udp

Unblock IP Address in IPtables Firewall
iptables -D INPUT -s xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -j DROP 	#-D deletes the rule 

Block Specific Port on IPtables Firewall
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport xxx -j DROP
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport xxx -j ACCEPT

Allow Multiple Ports on IPtables using Multiport
iptables -A INPUT  -p tcp -m multiport --dports 22,80,443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m multiport --sports 22,80,443 -j ACCEPT


-s address Specifies the source address of packets for a rule.
-d address Specifies the destination address of packets for a rule.
-sport port# Specifies the source port number for a rule.
-dport port# Specifies the destination port number for a rule.
-p protocol Specifies the protocol type for a rule.
-i interface Specifies the input network interface.
-o interface Specifies the output network interface.
-j action Specifies the action that is taken for a rule.
-m match Specifies a match parameter that should be used within the rule. The most common match used is state, which creates a stateful packet filtering firewall.
-A chain Specifies the chain used.
-L chain Lists rules for a certain chain. If no chain is given, all chains are listed.

all iptables are stored in memory, if you want to store them persistently you must do the following.
apt install iptables-persistent
in fedora20 service iptables save
-P policy Specifies the default policy for a certain chain type.
-D number Deletes a rule for a chain specified by additional arguments. Rules start at number 1.
-R number Replaces a rule for a chain specified by additional arguments. Rules start at number 1.
-F chain Removes all rules for a certain chain. If no chain is specified, it removes all rules for all chains.

1.
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 1:21 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 23:79 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 81:442 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 444:2221 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222
# iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 2223:65535 -j REDIRECT --to-port 2222

2.
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 3124 -j DNAT --to-destination 1.1.1.1:3000

3. 
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; This Would PAT all traffic routed to eth0

4.
No protocol will do all protocols so wouldn't have to specify ICMP. 
ICMP
 iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -d 192.168.3.0/24 -p icmp -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.11
 iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -d 192.168.4.1,192.168.4.2 

5. POC Subnet and Multi
PSUEDO: Destination addresses NAT 192.168.3.0/24 to 192.168.1.11
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -d 192.168.3.0/24 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.11
iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -d 192.168.4.2,192.168.4.3 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.11; # I did this to prove they both work
	although I could not find the rules in persistant files 
If traffic is originated from the box say from IP 192.168.1.11 it may not NAT atleast in my situation. 
Scaled: 192.168.3.0/24 to 192.168.1.11 and then all services 1:65535 to port 2222 which is a tarpit.

6.
Apt install iptables-persistant
ls /etc/iptables
