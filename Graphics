Until recently, X Windows was governed by a separate license than the GPL, which restricted the usage of X Windows and its source code.
 As a result, open source developers created an open source version of X Windows in the 1990s. This freely available version of X Windows
 is used in many Linux distributions and is called XFree86 because it was originally intended for the Intel x86 platform.
 
So X.org and xfree86 are both X windows implementations that are available for linux desktops
