If you need this mounted at boot if there is a power outage or any other kind of issue you need s startup script.
It is not controlled by the /etc/fstab
zfs mount datastore1 datastore2 datastore3 datastore4

zpool create datastorage1 /dev/sdb    # creates a pool with simply one disk you can find datastore1 in root directory
# use the mount command to verify it worked

zpool list # lists all of your zetabyte pools

zpool create datastorage2 /dev/sdc /dev/sdd # a spanned volume no raid both disks mount to one point
 # oracle says its striped but oraacle is wrong and the book is correct through trial and error test ubuntu 16.04.01 
theres is most likely proprietary and not open source.

zpool create datastorage3 mirror /dev/sde /dev/sdf  # create a mirrored mount point half the storage w/ redundancy

 zpool status datastorage3  #status of specific pool
# if you find that you have a bad disk lets say it is the /dev/sde

 zpool detach datastorage3 /dev/sde # remove it from the pool remove the disk replace with a good disk
zpool attach datastorage3 /dev/sdf /dev/sde 
 
zpool create datastorage4 raidz /dev/sdg /dev/sdh /dev/sdi # raidz is raid 5

 zfs create datastorage4/research # create directory in your pool with the zfs command

 zfs list # shows you your datastorage pools and subsystems (directory structure)

 zfs get all datastorage4/research | less # lists specific configuration parameters that you can modify
